# blarg
`blarg` is a command line argument parser for Rust.
In brief, it provides type-safe, domain sensitive, argument-option paradigm command line parser functionality.
Check out the rustdoc for more information.

"blarg" is derived from the following:
* **arg** for argument parser.
* **bl**arg because all the other names are already taken.
